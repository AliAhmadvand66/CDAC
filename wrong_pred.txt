well that is hard	sv	aa
now i asked janice or somebody recently how you do that uh when you paint the ceilings you know where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with	qy	sd
how do you get the edge	qw	br
the the straight edge	qy	aa
you just have to be real careful	qy	sd
oh i see	bk	b
huh	b	%
or two tone or two tone you know	sd	^2
there are some columns that could be painted a different color too	sv	sd
on the out	%	bf
well you have got to get one of those ladders	sv	ad
and it it's just too high	sv	sd
it is really scary	sv	sd
but and the only thing i would consider doing a professional maybe doing that	sv	sd
the blowers	qy	qy^d
those where you built like a rafter thing	sv	sd
scaffold	b^m	sd
that's it	sv	sd
huh	b	%
yeah	b	aa
oh i think that is what we might have to do with this chimney	sv	sd
but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself	sv	sd
it wasn't too bad	sd	sv
shoot maybe a hundred and fifty	sv	sd
yeah	b	bk
but then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it	sv	sd
so that was really worth it painting his own house	sd	bf
yeah	b	aa
but yeah	%	b^m
i think we are going to do uh another bathroom	sv	sd
oh i know	ba	aa
well a little paintbrush	sd	%
uh well i don't actually live in the city	sd	h
but i'd probably say that's roughly right	sd	aap
uh huh	b	aa
yeah	b	%
about fifteen miles	sd	b^m
our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably robberies house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drugs uh reported	sd	sv
and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices sensors and things like that	sv	sd
it's cut back you know considerably	sv	sd
but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood	sd	sv
so it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high	sd	sv
are there are there any theories on why this is happening	qw	qy
uh i would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon	sd	sv
well most families most families are young	sv	sd
and both people are working	sv	sd
uh so uh i would say that's probably their prime motivation	sd	sv
they'll they'll stock your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there	sd	sv
uh they classify most of them as professionals	sd	na
uh you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick	sv	sd
well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime	qy	qw
oh right now i think we are about thirty thousand people	sd	sv
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place	qh	sv
course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever	sv	sd
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh	sv	sd
that would be certainly be a deterrent	sv	na
you know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate uh	sv	ad
course i i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof	^q	sv
so you'd you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody	sv	bf
i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody	sv	aa
and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow through with that	sv	sd
huh	b	%
uh especially you know in the case of murder	sv	sd
and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh you know the guy only got five years	sv	sd
do what now	qy	br
there's nothing that he has that that you could go after	sv	^q
yeah	b	aa
uh very seld	sv	%
but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt	sv	sd
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money	sv	sd
that's too bad	sv	ba
and uh you know and they're right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're you know they're they're repeat offenders	sv	sd
they've been released you know several times which is another uh deal i hate to see	sd	sv
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes	qy^d	sv
yeah	b	aa
what what deterrent does he really have	qw	qh
yeah	ny	b
yeah	b	b^m
they've actually waited for them where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood	t3	sd
then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands	sv	sd
course it doesn't always work out in their favor	sv	sd
but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us	sv	sd
you can you know you can get some of us	sv	^q
you can't get all of us	sv	^q
uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that	sv	sd
here you break in	sv	sd
and you're going to get shot	^q	sd
but then just another different set of people come in	sv	sd
huh	b	%
uh i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas you know across the the border	sd	sv
it's not many from the local communities	sd	sv
uh huh	b	aa
i mean i i tend to agree with you	sd	aa

they they went to all all	sd	%
okay	b	b^m

and i thought that was really good	sd	sv
and i think if they uh	%	sv
takes two weeks for that system to process uh your request for uh not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition	sv	sd
you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that	sv	sd
that would be nice	ba	sv

you have a little uh thing on the bo bottom of th on top of the barrel where you you turn it	qy	sd
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get	sv	sd
and i guess it doesn't have any any automatic features to it	sv	sd
i think it was a three fifty seven	sd	sv
plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in	sv	sd
in fact i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon	sd	sv
he was fortunate	sd	sv
he could he could of hit something else	sv	sd
about uh private citizens selling a weapons	qy	bf
uh that's a hard one because we did that	sd	h

if they go to uh regulating uh all right uh banning guns pri pri pri private cit citizens	sv	sd

well they're going to beep us pretty soon	sv	sd
thanks	fc	ft
we're going to talk about the public school system what's wrong with it an or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it	qw	sd
oh lord i mean yeah	aa	b
i tell you what	^h	o
what gets me is i can't believe that congress uh or our state legislature can't come up with uh some kind of workable means to have funds for the school	sd	sv
sure don't	aa	sd
okay	bk	b
so it's getting close	sd	bf
yeah	b	aa
he's going to be going to kindergarten	sv	sd
so you know we're we're thinking about that	sv	sd
are they going to be taught nothing	qy	qh
or they going be taught something	sv	qh
we're going to be teaching him what we can at home of course because uh i guess we don't trust the school system which is very sad uh	sv	sd
i mean give me a break	^q	o
and dallas uh school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling	sv	sd
i mean good grief what's	sv	ba
now that's that's just unbelievable to me you know	sv	sd
well yeah	ny	b
no	nn	b
i mean i'd i'd be afraid to be in school i mean teaching or even being a student	sd	sv
and think what what's it going to be like for my my youngest an my oldest son when he goes to school	sd	ad
what's going to happen	qw	qh
right	b	aa
yeah	b	aa
and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school	sd	sv
that was what twelve years ago i guess	sd	qy^d
right	b	na
and what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son is in high school	sd	qh
i'm afraid to i'm afraid to even think about it	sv	sd
that yeah that is a scary thought	sv	aa
the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera	sd	sv
i maybe i'm wrong because i haven't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time	sv	h
need to teach them good values	^q	sv
you've got to start them at the home you know	ad	sv
and and and uh and that's about right	sd	sv
okay	b	fc
could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution	qy	qw
well it's hard to say	sv	^h
what do you think	qw	qo
um well you talked about uh volcanos	^h	sd
i'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and and what the amount of material that they do uh put into the atmosphere	qw	sd
okay	b	bk
so ca can you notice	%	qy
attleboro itself	%	sd
oh i see	bk	b
but there isn't a lot of heavy industry	sv	sd
and it seems like uh we're catching all that residue	sd	sv
yeah	b	ny
we generate	%	sd
um there doesn't seem to be much emission from them	sd	sv
i notice locally a major problem is kodak	sd	sv
because in order to uh keep with the a standards which which tend to be visible uh what's coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night	qw	sd
surprise surprise	sd	ba
during the night seems like they'd blow off their their stacks from uh the warehouses for powerhouses	sv	sd
so you're right	qy	sd
yeah	b	aa
how are your uh your lakes	qw	qo
they have	qy	qy^d
but um yeah	ny	%
yeah	b	%
acid rain	sd	b^m
yeah	ny	b
i'm not an expert	sd	h
yeah	b	aa
no	nn	aa
up here	qy	b
yeah	ny	b
that's interesti	sv	ba
but i i thought it was up there	sd	sv
so that's interesting because new hampshire and parts of vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain	sd	sv
well that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article	sd	arp
oh they didn't say they didn't say what though	qy	bf
they just said they thought it was	sd	o
they didn't say what	sd	na
uh natural disease	sd	bf
yeah	b	aa
so it's it's less than clear	sd	sv
i still think that's that's uh one of our major causes of pollutants	sd	sv
and the new cars it's hardly is hardly anything	sd	sv
yeah	b	aa
uh when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch smoke or uh	sd	qw
but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune	sv	qy
you think that that that the uh the trucking indus industry is that uh incompetent that they wouldn't you know	sv	qy^d
fuel is is one of their biggest costs	sv	sd
but diesel engines	sd	%
but only because we got used to uh single person single car driving	sd	sv
the uh united states and canada are i guess is is going into uh some types of agreements to limit uh what's being given out by power plants	sv	sd
i guess canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there	sv	sd
so that's helping	sd	sv
and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted	qw	o
don't say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue	sd	ad
well it just means if you don't pollute right or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax	qy	sd
maybe you you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe	sd	sv
and you couldn't start your car anymore	^q	sd
that's a that's an interesting concept	sv	ba
i guess the difficulty would be to that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again	sd	sv
so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something	qy	sv
well i was going to say	na	sd
right	b	aa
if you can take a muffler off and only replace	sv	sd
but if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that uh busses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax uh this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters	sv	sd
that's a that's quite a concept	sv	ba
that's a good idea	ba	sv
but that's a that's a thought	sv	sd
no	nn	%
you're right	aa	sv
the automobile regulatory agencies or something	sv	bf
other than that i'm not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization	sd	sv

i mean this is the kind of thing you look at	sv	sd
you sit there	sv	sd

it teaches them pride in their country	sd	sv
yeah	b	aa
that's like eagle scouts	sd	sv
sure	b	aa
uh huh	b	aa
and that's a great idea	ba	sv
i think they ought to take them and i don't know just have sort of like a a a manpower pool and say okay look	fc	sd
uh huh	b	bk
uh i guess i bicycle	fc	sd
uh huh	b	bk
but uh i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise	sv	sd
yeah	ny	b
it can be a pain	sv	sd
not so much	no	ng
uh well actually my wife just got me into it	sd	^h
um	b	%
yeah	b	aa
yeah	aa	b
i just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like you know uh uh touring like from vermont or you know that kind of thing	sd	qy
one is more of a distance	sd	sv
and one's more just you know	%	sv
they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour	sd	sv
i've it's kind of funny	sd	sv
so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation	sd	sv
it's it's really neat	ba	sv
there are a lot of a lot of resources a lot of magazines and stuff	sv	sd
just go to the bike shock bi bike shop and pick it up	sd	ad
yeah	b	%
yeah	b	bk
it gives you increased ls and decreases your ls	sv	sd
you say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week	qy	qy^d
yeah	b	%
i mean there are some people	%	sv
uh i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because it will help your balance when you're indoor training	sv	sd
but yeah	b	%
so you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a	sv	bf
oh yeah	b	aa
yeah	ny	aa
it's it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path uh	sv	sd
so it's fairly picturesque	sd	sv
and uh so it's it's it's a good ride	sv	sd
yeah	b	aa
that's uh motivating	sd	sv
that's really good	ba	sv
and i just uh	sd	%
	x	b
especially i guess it's even harder on single mothers	sd	sv
oh yeah	b	aa
the	%	sd
having to pick up the kid by you know six o'clock	sd	^2
or it's five dollars for every minute you're late and stuff like that	sv	sd
which is understandable	ba	sv
i mean these people can't you know stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late	sd	sv
just sit around	sd	^2
yeah	b	b^m
that's pretty bad	ba	sv
of course you don't ha	sv	%
	x	%
	x	b
oh	b	ba
and i mean they'd you know	sd	%
watch whatever you want	sv	^q
and there's some oreos in the in the cupboard	sv	^q
and there's some coke	sd	^q
and you know just help yourself to anything	sv	^q
	x	ba
just once a	%	sd
	x	b
oh yeah	b	aa
and they stick around for longer	sd	sv
she does take up	sd	^2
yeah	b	aa
yeah	b	aa
but i don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat	sd	^q
eat this or	sd	^2
that's	%	aa
so i can see the concerns on what different people want	sd	sv
	x	b
	x	b
cause some parents won't put up anything where others would	sd	sv
uh	%	b
and just have like at the most like ten kids	sd	sv
	x	ar
more than what it's worth	sv	bf
yeah	ny	aa
yeah	b	b^m
and they just want to sue you	^q	sv
well yeah	b	aa
yeah	b	aa
and that's just you know	sd	%
that's	%	sv
and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in you know	sv	sd
you know just awful things	sv	sd
if i mean i don i can't foresee myself getting married	sd	sv
but if you know if i ever wanted to have a kid how could i work	sd	qh
i mean i don't think i could trust somebody with my kid either	sd	sv
oh yeah	b	aa
that's	%	aa
i just i couldn't do it i don't think	sd	sv
it would just rip me apart i think	sd	sv
just not	sv	sd
just besides the fact that you know your when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait	sv	sd
well the topic's about government	o	sd
uh i'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic uh	sv	sd
i mean that's what i would like to think	sd	sv
and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons	sd	sv
yeah	b	aa
that makes sense	ba	sv
that's it	aa	ba
uh things that you don't know uh do do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray	qy	sv
people could say oh they do it	sv	sd
a and and and as far as uh you know myself having any particular personal uh knowledge or insight into politics or politicians it i'm not terribly involved in it	qrr	sd
just in a very cursory way	sv	sd
and they certainly do get inside information	sd	sv
okay	b	b^m
well it's kind of hard to say	sv	^h
uh because i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years	sv	sd
	fc	%
wait a minute	ad	^h
uh it's rather difficult to to project what kind of uh	fc	sv
and uh uh we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when when the cars could get to be discounted	sv	sd
so uh	fc	%
well we we've had uh	sd	%
let me think	oo	^h
but i don't know	no	h
we'll we're going to be in the market for a car probably in the next year	sv	sd
and the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they give good financing through the the motor company	sv	sd
but i don't know what we're going to buy	^q	sd
i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car	sd	sv
well	%	b
i'll bet it was hard to part with that	t3	sv
yeah	b	aa
because uh it it it was great fun	sd	sv
more money	^2	%
and actually i'm concerned that they're not	sv	sd
uh	%	b
and they're letting the information out slowly about how you know how big it is	sd	sv
	x	b
so i guess i'm i'm i'd like to see us spend more	sd	sv
i'm i'm ambivalent about it because um uh i well it is very frightening and scary	sd	sv
you mean more money for that means less for cancer or	sv	bf
yes	ny	aa
and uh whether those diseases can yo	sv	%
uh	b	%
i don't know whether whether you know where our money would be most effectively spent	sd	sv
i i agree with you there	fc	aa
because i know every time that i something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one	sd	sv
and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie	qy^d	sd
or do they both get served	qrr	qy
uh that's a good point	na	sv
and i'm i am concerned a lot about uh i'm concerned about uh two things	sd	sv
and the other is for uh for uh treating the illness	sv	sd
and i'm not certain	%	sd
i'm telling you	fc	o
and i'm with you that i don't know is is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more	qrr	sv
that's that's the part that	sv	%
whether my dentist or	sd	%
that's the part that scares me you know	t3	sv
well no	nn	^q
it's for homosexuals and gays	sv	^q
well no	nn	^q
actually it's	%	^q
i mean you know	sd	h
did they know that all along	qy	qh
and uh and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions	sv	sd
yes	aa	^q
and i don't know that's true or not	h	sd
	x	b
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and	sv	qw
and how is it really transmitted et	qh	qw
	x	b
i think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know	sd	sv
but but that isn't how it was in africa	sv	sd
	x	aa
and it's beginning other countries	sd	%
that's what's his point	sv	sd
uh	%	b
and does that mean like flus and everything else there are all these different strains of it	qy	qh
i mean i don't know	h	sd
yeah	aa	b
and uh and then the people that have it	%	sd
if you if i were dying i'm not sure i would care	sd	sv
i i give me cyanide	^q	ad
yeah	aa	b
	x	b
i mean if i'm dying if i know i'm dying you can experiment on me	sd	sv
	x	aa
go	%	ad
and why can't you why can't the a say you know i if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys and well let them	sv	qh
	x	aa
let them do	oo	ad
	x	b
i'll start off here	t3	oo
but it makes it really convenient cause i keep a rather hectic schedule	sd	sv
right	aa	b
	x	b
but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from	sd	sv
	x	b
uh prior to cable you know you didn't get much news off of normal uh television broadcasts	sd	sv
uh just usually pretty local in in nature	sd	sv
and and i like uh because you get some world world events too uh which is not too common on on the other format newspapers and so forth	sd	sv
that that's true you know	sv	aa
	x	b
uh whereas if you pick up a a european paper you know uh it all the surrounding countries soviet union and everything has uh major news uh articles in them	sv	sd
and uh it's amazing that	%	sv
i mean the most they'll give it is the back of the a section	sv	sd
you just never see you just never see anything about it	sv	sd
and and they carry quite a bit about the on the other hand	sd	sv
yeah	b	aa
and it's sort of like uh a too	sd	sv
you you can tune into some stations	sv	sd
and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all	sv	sd
there's not much in the way of television in some of those places	sv	sd
	x	b
right	b	aa
yeah	b	aa
and uh you know i i was amazed cause i'd pick up a local paper and i'd read about all of these you know really interesting things going on	sd	sv
what is it called	t1	qw
right	aa	b
it's improved	sd	sv
it's uh i mean it's news is not not that way	sv	sd
and they they do some pretty good news	sv	sd
so i'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too uh and catch something maybe a little different than than might be covering	sv	sd
uh some more in interest type topics in in other countries	sv	sd
the latin american situation in	sv	sd
and i support that fully	sd	sv
i'm not sure we have the right solution to it	sd	sv
and the source of supply	sv	sd
very definitely so	sv	aa
no	nn	aa
right	b	aa
but they need to learn how to stand on their own own two feet also	t3	sv
i know	sd	aa
are extremely poor	sv	^2
and and just very happy to get that	sd	bf
oh yes	b	aa
yes	b	aa
and this is very much his you know reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor	sv	sd
oh the there's a joke	ba	sd
and in a way	sv	%
but there's a joke about the uh ambassador from latin america that came to visit a senator in the and was taken to his home for dinner	sv	sd
how can you afford all of this	qw	^q
and the uh senator said do you see that hospital over there	qy	sd
he said you see that school over there	qy	sd
how can you afford this uh in such a poor country	qw	^q
and he walked out the backyard	^q	sd
and he said do you see that hospital over there	qy	sd
intentions intentions	sv	o
um	%	b
well the oth the other instance i think of their inability to to handle things the cholera and hepatitis epidemics now in in latin america	sv	sd
yes	b	aa
yes	ny	aa
and yet they're so	sd	%
and they're they're so rich in resources there	sv	sd
and they're very rich in gold and silver and very rich in in uh natural resources such as the fish and uh timber and and copper and all types of uh resources	sv	sd
and the uranium	sd	^2
but they don't have	%	sv
the technology	b^m	bf
right	b	aa
and they they're very	sd	%
well	%	b
and you know they're very willing to be taught in many cases now too	sd	sv
uh huh	b	aa
it it's sort of illustrated by the uh world bank and international monetary fund not wanting to continue to do business there	qy	sd
well	%	b
and i think that you know it	%	sv
somewhat a sarcastic view	sv	h
but some of those drugs czars you know	sv	sd
you know	aa	%
we're hearing the same	sd	sv
which would still give the uh the grower in columbia and elsewhere in latin america the uh the money that they apparently need and go go to the illegal crop for	sv	sd
in the long run	sd	^2
and in the short run probably too	sd	sv
course then could you know at at some point could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind	sv	qy
no	ar	nn
you know	b	%
argentine beef	sv	^2

yeah	b	aa
oh you're kidding	ba	bh
huh uh	b	nn
sounds like a lot of fun	ba	sv
yeah	b	%
it's amazing to me how how many things they would allow to occur before you know you can come in	qw^d	sv
you know i think	sv	%
well and you know uh my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life you know	sv	sd
well think of how many illegal aliens have have have been uh uh sent back to mexico just to find their way back	qw	sv
that's right	aa	sv
that's our money	sd	sv
yes	ny	aa
that's true	aa	sv
i i think	aa	%
anyway do you have anything else in the the subject uh that you might want to talk about	qw	qy
this is spur of the moment uh	sd	h
yeah	b	aa
connections and money	sd	^2
yeah	b	aa
is there anything i believe in	sd	qy
i'm not sure how long they're supposed to be	qw^d	sd
it's good hearing your your point of view	fc	sd
i did too	sd	aa
well thanks	fc	ft
thanks	fc	ft
actually the they're both going on their own most of the time	sv	sd
so uh most of our activities are you know just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and that kind of thing	qw	sd
a girl	qy	b^m
uh i guess uh what i see is so far as uh the trends uh uh for children uh	sd	sv
and i think uh the big city uh	sd	sv
that you really have to watch your children so closely now	sd	sv
that you can't let them grow up the way the way i grew up you know	sd	sv
i i feel like uh	%	sv
that it's it's really a sad commentary on uh you know a life in general	sd	sv
just start not even	sv	sd
there's a lot of emphasis on on on on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten	qy	sv
the uh there i there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum	sd	sv
a lot more available of course	sd	sv
i i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself	sd	sv
or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when i went to school	sd	sv
yeah	aa	b
i think uh	sv	%
that uh uh watching a little little boys play soccer is is more fun	sd	sv
i can't imagine th them having as much fun as the parents had watching them	sd	sv
the the disorganized play really what it was	sd	bf
yeah	b	aa
um an an and the and that's kind of contradictory to what i said	sd	sv
but when they're in school they they don't have quite quite as much control over them as uh as what i would liked to have seen	sd	sv
uh uh i kind of feel like there's there's too much allowed to go on in at at school	sd	sv
you always have the lack of funds	qy^d	sd
very faint yeah	aa	b
and it you know trickled ou	sv	%
so what do you think about caring for older folks dale	qw	qo
uh i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home	^q	sd
very faint	sd	%
he's ninety i think right on ninety right now	sv	sd
right	na	b
and it's creating a lot of problems	sv	sd
right	aa	b
especially for your uncle i bet	sv	qy^d
yes	b	ny
in dallas	sd	^h
uh yeah	b	ny
so they are pretty limited	sv	bf
right	b	aa
oh another interesting thing	ba	sv
another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology wa well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities	sv	sd
i don't think that was mainly with alzheimer's patients but just patients people in general who were not as independent as they use to be	sd	sv
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those	sv	sd
right	b	aa
right	b	aa
but if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly	sv	sd
you can't play those things	sv	bf
yeah	b	aa
you can't do it	sv	sd
but you can sing songs and uh and tell stories about the old times	sd	sv
i guess you know you were talking about your	sv	sd
uh huh	b	ny
uh huh	b	ny
my grandmother doesn't	no	ng
which is fine you know	sd	sv
sure	b	aa
do you	bh	qy
oh the wood chuck song	sd	b^m

someday	b	^2
yeah	b	aa
okay	bk	fc
okay	bk	fc
i'm not sure i'm familiar with with what they mean of invasion of privacy	sd	sv
but uh now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says mrs miller have we got a deal for you	sd	sv
you're like no you don't no	nn	sd
it's like how do you know my name	^q	sd
where did you get my phone number	qw	^q

i mean those people they'll call you any time of the day or night with try to solicit	sd	sv
they call late	sd	sv
see that's ridi	sv	%
well	%	b
really	b	bh
uh huh	b	ny
don't answer your phone hello	qy	ad
the computer's geared to to start talking to you on the on the word hello	sv	sd
i think like things that that	sv	%
i think's like privacy is like just like not going through my stuff like going through just like my clothes or my drawer just going through my stuff basically	sd	sv
and she still goes through your clothes	qy	qy^d
ooh	b	ba
so i prefer that you just not go in and get them	sd	^q
oh yeah	b	aa
she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff	sv	sd
i was trying to think	sd	^h
and now if we go through her cabinets she's like well what are you digging for	qw	sd
get out of my cabinets	sd	bf
like what are you doing	qw	sd
don't you have your own house to dig through	qy	^q
so i guess privacy is really	sv	%
oh well actually yes	b	aa
you could tell	aa	bf
you know you put your stuff where it's	^q	bf
	x	aa
	x	bh
yeah	b	ny
why are they working at my desk	qh	^q

then you start missing stuff	sd	qy^d
oh yeah	b	ny
no mommy is going to take the vitamins	sv	sd
i'm sorry	fa	h
i have	sd	%
because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff	ad	sv
and you know how it looks and everything	sd	sv
well you know how you left it the day before	sd	sv
that would bother me definitely	ad	sd
oh yeah	b	aa
yeah	ny	aa
see	ny	%
yeah	b	ny
you know	b	%
that's the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy like something every day though	sv	sd
yeah	aa	b
well actually i do know	h	sd
um	o	b
you know what i mean	sd	qy
uh huh	b	ny
an yet i felt that i got a good education	sd	sv
but you tell me to name you know five continents	ad	sd
i just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education	sd	sv
well talking about public education um i'm we're doing a proposal	fc	sd
so that's kind of in a higher level	sd	sv
yeah	ny	b
uh huh	b	bk
like in what sense	qy	qo
you had to learn	bf	sv
that's bad	ba	sv
our state cut a whole bunch of a i think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget	sv	sd
so they're making all kind of cuts	sv	sd
it's pretty sorry	fa	sv
i forget	fc	sd
i mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports or anything like that	qy	sd
that to me shows a little uh switch in priorities	sd	sv
you know	b	%
are yo	ny	%
you're a so you're a senior now	sd	qy^d
yeah	b	ny
um is is university is that uh state	sd	qy
what did you say	qw	br
state	sd	b^m
that's a state university then	sd	qy^d
yeah	b	ny
and you're from there also	qy	qy^d
i see	b	bk
oh is it	ba	qy
yeah state's not that bad	aa	sv
and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did	sd	sv
and i i feel like what i've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school	sd	sv
and i know that i'm drawing a lot of what i learned in school you know	sd	sv
i i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on on art	sd	sv
she calls them just some basics about um you know you don't take what's not yours	qh	sd
like no hitting you know	sv	sd
that's sorry	fa	sv
that they that they like pick on th the advanced students and pay more attention to them ignore the others	sd	bf
yeah	b	aa
it's true	aa	sv
and i don't know if it makes them feel better	h	sd
i mean the do teachers get	sd	%
um graduate school	b	na
oh yeah	b	bh
i think i'm going to chappel hill	sd	na
never heard of the uh tarheels	qy	qy^d
i don't know that area	h	sd
the a tarheels	qy	qy^d
i just don't know it	no	ng
so obviously you're into education	bf	qy^d
if you can be going	sv	%
i know	aa	sd
overloaded	sd	sv
okay	b	fc
thank you	fc	ft
but no uh no snow	sd	ng
and it's getting quite serious as far as water next summer	sd	sv
but this year it wasn't bad at all	sd	sv
i guess that's because we had so much rain	sd	sv
it's always too damn cold too damn hot too damn windy	sv	^q
but i imagine if it's that cold in dallas it	sd	sv
well el paso won't be cold	sd	ar
the uh you'll be flying in there	qy	qy^d
well uh take off is uh fun from el paso because you normally	fc	sv
the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain the rockies	qy	sd
yes	ny	b
and they're towering above you	sv	sd
and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again	qy	sd
yeah	aa	b
and we have a	sd	%
the mountains are are really uh high	qy	sd
we really need the moisture	sd	sv
yeah	ny	b
well that's that's what the	sd	%
well that's nice comfortable stuff	ba	sv
yes	b	aa
open shirt open at the neck you know no tie	sv	sd
that's nice	ba	sv
so my dress code is very very	sd	ng
oh	b	bk
yeah	ny	b
so then it's still you know the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and coming in out of the office	sv	sd
uh	ny	b
and it it was very interesting	sd	sv
uh most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual almost the same clothes that that you'd wear to school	sv	sd
that must be nice atmosphere then	sv	qy^d
well it has been	fc	na
how shall i say it	^q	h
but they don't	%	sv
there's no notice at all	sd	sv
so people uh how shall i say it made a made much more effort to notice you acknowledge your presence say hello and uh things like that	qw	sd
it's like a mini little study there	sd	sv
and so this dress for success thing i think is uh	sd	sv
by and large i've i'm kind of uh convinced that uh by that just that one uh uh experience and then having talked to several other people that that uh unless you're in a an environment where they're going to make fun of of of better clothes that better clothes always pay off	sd	sv
doesn't mean they have to be uh	%	sd
and it can be quite warm in the summertime	sv	sd
that's good for the clothes budget i would	sd	qy^d
yes	aa	ny
it	%	sd
low twenties let's say	^q	sd
well i agree with the boredom of the election process	sd	aa
and it's just why make the effort	sv	sd
because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day to day lives	sv	sd
well maybe part of the problem is they don't they think they have enough choices	qy	sv
you know in some of the european countries they have numbers of parties that run	sv	sd
and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country	sv	sd
uh i think voter awareness	sv	%
they don't get a lot of participation	sv	sd
they don't get a lot of uh activity	sv	sd
most of the league of women voters what they did was they put out information so that it it would just be made available to everyone	sv	sd
and it would just you know	sv	%
and and for campaign that's it	sv	sd
it's a it's an ongoing campaign	sv	aa
uh maybe more qualified and uh more dedicated to the issues	^2	sv
well it's a matter of name recognition	sd	sv
people aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of	sd	sv
if a if the time wasn't so	sd	%
if it wasn't such a long uh campaigning time then they couldn't spend as much money	sv	sd
no	nn	aa
so we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers	sv	bf
and uh that kind of thing can make and break make or break you	sv	sd
he possibly could have uh won that election had it not been for some of the the uh the way he presented himself	sd	sv
well he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease	sd	sv
hoof is is i guess the right term for him	sv	aa
yes	b	aa
and uh the the interesting scale that they assigned it uh the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free	sv	sd
i'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle i guess	sd	sv
i i don't mind regulating all of the the guns	sd	sv
and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types	sd	sv
and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes	sd	sv
but there still the the technology exists to to check it if they want	sv	sd
so it's it's kind of a	sv	%
and then you've got the group of people that decide that there's there's no particular reason to have them at all	sv	sd
and it costs a bit to do it uh finding ranges and things like	sd	sv
so uh i i don't see the the joy of shooting as as that much of a driving factor	sd	sv
and you boy you can get them on either side	sv	sd
and just like you say	sv	sd
or not	%	ar
onto no control	nn	sd
i mean it	%	sd
are you	%	qy
that's a big city	sd	sv
and he's going to you know try to shoot first	^q	sd
uh and if not	%	sd
uh then usually they uh	%	sd
and had time to do anything about it	sd	sv
in the uh as uh claim that the uh the constitutional the right to bear arms and that whole statement uh	qy	sd
not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia	qy	sv
you know there's all sorts of arguments there	sv	sd
no	aa	b
no	nn	aa
so we change our rights with our social status	sd	sv
they're man given rights	sv	sd
they can go live in another country if they want	sv	sd
well yeah	aa	b
i know well	%	sd
they you know they say there should be no ban	sv	sd
but i can't see why any uh on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun	sd	sv
but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh sport	sd	sv
and if they do	%	sd
course the argument with the people in the gun club uh is that uh well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway	qy	sd
and so it's not going to be that they're buying them	sv	sd
tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people	sv	bf
oh yeah	b	aa
so what do you	o	qw
what's your opinion on the our policy down there	qw	qo
i didn't know we had one either	sd	sv
we seem to uh	%	sv
well uh	%	b
yeah	ny	b
but we just talked a lot	sd	sv
we didn't actually do anything	sd	sv
right	b	aa
we didn't do anything	sd	sv
i'm actually surprised at anything in central america along with panama	sd	sv
i'm just kind of surprised we did that	sd	sv
especially after our friend jimmy carter gave it away anyway	sd	aa
actually bush has been better at that than i thought	fc	sv
he has a little more a little more of a stand on policy than i thought he would	sd	sv
i always considered him kind of a wimp	sd	sv
he takes more risks	sd	sv
yeah	b	aa
he was	%	aa
but you know if we we back up what we what we say with actions	sd	sv
we have so far	sd	sv
i don't know how long it's going to last	qw^d	sd
of course we really haven't taken on the drug lords yet	sd	sv
i'd be interested to see if we do that	sd	sv
well we did in panama	^q	sv
we did in saudi arabia	sd	sv
no	nn	ar
but see the thing when panama was uh the that uh noriega was uh was was uh was wanted fo either the i by the i	sd	sv
and therefore they had a reason	sd	sv
i don't know if they could do it or not	h	sv
it addresses the problem	sv	sd
oh the drug problem	qy	br
uh huh	b	b^m
it it's quite timely	sd	sv
you know it it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is failing	sd	sv
we just don't we just don't	sv	%
don't want to admit it yet	sv	^2
yep pause	b	aa
yeah	b	aa
that's true	aa	sv
and they have blinders on as far as the policy goes	sd	sv
but but the minute it hit hits the paper then of course the kennedys and the misinvolves and the udalls and the and uh the dawes from georgia all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is	sd	sv
but i guess it automa	sv	%
and it it's probably basically uh	sv	%
probably	b	aa
every time you drink scotch you're paying kennedys	qy	sv
don't ever drink scotch	sd	ad
we don't want to piss them off and have them over produce	sd	sv
you know the same old cliche	sv	sd
it's all traditional	sd	sv
they have to	%	sv
you have the ruling class	sd	sv
well i guess that's about five minutes	sv	fc
it was very pleasant	sd	fc
hey what was that book	qw^d	qw
uh huh	b	aa
okay	b	bk
all right	b	bk
all right	fc	aa
thanks a lot	fc	ft
all righty	fc	bd
well yes	aa	o
well it it	arp	%
some	%	no
and like right now it's uh it's kind of overcast you know	sv	sd
but it's it's holding in this this pollution	sd	sv
it depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take it	sd	sv
you do	bh	qy^d
well maybe not	sv	h
and you know my head and my fa	%	sd
i think that uh i think that uh uh	%	sv
something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off the road that have been uh manufactured say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining	sv	sd
you mean uh fifty percent pollution total from that comes from	^q	qy
yeah	b	ny
from from cars	sd	^2
okay	b	%
oh uh huh	b	bk
on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have	sd	sv
als	ba	%
yeah	b	ny
oh uh yeah	b	ny
i i we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in maryland	sd	sv
really	b	bh
yeah	b	ny
well for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant	sd	sv
and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate for just all kinds	sd	sv
and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution	sd	sv
i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is	sd	sv
but i just can't believe it is	sd	sv
and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer	sd	sv
and having all kinds of effects	sd	sv
and who ever does is going to make uh a mint	^q	sv
is that also what's in uh hairsp aerosol	qw	qy
well they used to be	no	na
even so so the aerosol is still aerosol	sv	qy^d
right	b	na
but it doesn't have anything that's damaging	sv	qy^d
no	aa	nn
they they they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers	sv	sd
well that's good	ba	sv
and that was a move in the right direction	sd	sv
we are doing some things to try to correct the problem	^q	sd
but there are more things we could do	sd	sv
and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem	sd	sv
uh uh just trying to i think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage	sd	sv
i don't know if you're doing it in texas yet or not	qy^d	sd
yeah	b	%
you're not you don't have to	sv	sd
i save	%	sd
no kidding	aa	ba
and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash they'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time	sv	sd
is that right	aa	bh
well we need to do something	^q	sv
we need to get serious about it	ad	sv
but on on the other hand i don't guess they're polluting	sd	sv
but plastic containers and the like uh they may be	sd	sv
how much does uh planting more trees and things like that help	qw	qo
too	aa	%
i i don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air	sd	sv
i would hope that they would help some though	sd	sv
that's for sure	ba	sv
and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway	sv	sd
i think they got caught	sv	sd
i would assu	sd	%
but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state	qrr	sd
so i'm assu i'm assuming that you know they check they check everything for safety	sd	qy^d
i don't know	h	no
uh that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities	sv	sd
but that's all they check for	sd	qy^d
they don't check how good	qw^d	qy^d
if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough	qy	qy^d
in virginia they check that every two years i think	sd	sv
not no not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily	sv	sd
and that's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants	sd	sv
well i'll have to check	fc	sd
oh i would	aa	sd
oh yeah	b	aa
i mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution	sv	sd
but water pollution uh	sv	%
well	b	arp
because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap	sv	sd
tap	%	b^m
yeah	b	%
if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're what you're drinking	sv	sd
because it seems uh	%	sv
and and that was some of the best tasting water	sd	sv
but uh that was that was really wonderful	sd	sv
it was really really good	sd	sv
um so what do you think	qw	qo
um	%	^h
one one thing that i noticed is it's very very convenient to be alcoholic in sweden	sd	sv
because it's treated as a disease	na	sd
now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine	sv	sd
but uh if you're if you're alcoholic then you're treated as if you're on disability long term disability	qy	sd
and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that	sd	sv
also um another thing that that i noticed that was very strange	sd	sv
well it would be lower middle class housing here	sd	sv
and uh overall i gue their their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower	sd	sv
and it was it was less professional	sd	sv
and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver type job then a then a doctor type job	sd	sv
	x	b
that is uh that is something i've heard	sd	aa
probably the the major concern i have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to to get into uh the medical field	sd	sv
and so you know i'm real you know	sd	%
and and uh they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable	sv	sd
and that's ridiculous	ba	sv
you don't think it's abnormal	qy	qy^d
you're not saying it's right	sv	bf
you're just saying it's common	sv	bf
yeah	b	aa
and so i i it's i think i to me i think uh something that's going to help our medical uh arena is for um	sd	sv
and i don't know how to i don't know how to do this	qw^d	sd
	b	aa
clanking dishes woman and children	o	%
and we'll probably be looking for something about that uh that same style	sv	sd
that same kind of four door hard top style	fc	sd
okay	b	bk
yeah	ny	b
so that's probably where the first place we'd look	sv	sd
that'll do it	sd	ba
and that's great	ba	sv
and i drive uh	sd	%
so i i i bought a used uh dodge aries which has been okay	t3	sd
so it's just a ten minute commute every day	t3	sd
i mean it's not like i'm putting it through its paces	sd	sv
and it's a four door which is nice	sd	sv
but it's still a little cramped	sd	sv
sounds like you you need at least like a taurus size or something like that	fc	bf
yeah	b	aa
that's what i was thinking of	sd	aa
uh	b	%
they uh the ones that have uh families uh	sv	sd
and they still want kind of a sports car	sv	sd
that i guess it's the sports version of the taurus	qy	sd
and uh and a lot of those	%	sd
oh well sure	b	ba
and then you go what	qy	sv
right	aa	b
what would i besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun what would i really do with this car	qy	qh
right	aa	b
it's like i i guess i could fit in it maybe	sd	sv
	x	b
	x	b
	x	b
and uh funny funniest sight	sd	sv
and da you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car	bf	sv
i i'd learned on an automatic transmission and so so i'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car	^q	sd
boy that's a good deal	ba	sv
ah okay	^h	b
and it	%	sd
it was the craziest thing i ever saw	sd	sv
and and and that's probably why they were trying to sell them i guess	sd	sv
um okay	^h	b
you know it's like it's like a luxury car except that it's the dodge aries you know	sd	sv
well i guess that's i guess that's about all i've got to say about cars	fc	sd
the the thing about this uh th	%	sv
we thought that was a luxury car when we bought it	sd	sv
uh huh	b	aa
i would think so	aa	sv
yeah	b	aa
because it's so big	sv	bf
yeah	b	aa
and you can change the channels on the on the radio from the back seat too	sv	sd
now now now that used to be a luxury	sd	sv
right	b	aa
and you've got to pay for it too	sv	sd
yeah	b	aa
and i bet and i bet it costs twice as much as as when i bought mine	sd	sv
thanks a lot	fc	ft
clanking	fc	x
talking	%	x
i understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight	fc	sd
yes	b	aa
oh is that right	bh	qy
and so that uh helped out a little bit i think	sd	sv
i was so upset with texas that i haven't gotten into any more of his books because i thought it was just horrible	sd	sv
well he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes	sd	aa
well	%	h
and i don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in texas	fc	sv
so i wasn't sure how credible he was	sd	sv
oh is that right	bh	qy
but anyway what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights	qw	qo
well uh i'm not sure to be honest with you	no	^h

it was nice to go there	sd	sv

so it's this book was interesting though	sd	%
i uh	%	sv
oh yeah	b	aa
i would think so too	sv	aa
but they have to come in at a just the right angle	sv	sd
if you come in at the wrong angle what happens is they bounce off and go back into space	qw^d	sd
and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up	sv	sd
i'm sure you've seen more of them than i have	sd	sv
but you could see the scorch on them you know	sv	sd
they had though piles	sd	%

you put it around you pretty much	qy	na
well i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space	sd	sv

yes	b	aa

invisible fencing	na	sd
it's uh it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little uh transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter	qw	sd

if you put enough patience into	bf	sv

uh when working with the uh flashers there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers	sd	sv
i should look at that	^q	sv
diagram	b	^2
you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing	sv	sd
but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse	sv	sd
that's a good idea	ba	sv
exactly	aa	na
it's out of kansas somewhere	sv	sd
so it's not whitney or somebody like that	sd	qy^d
it's not	sv	sd

so it must be for a different year	sv	sd
well i had one person that i used for years and years on this car	sd	na

up here in rochester uh we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution	sv	sd
uh we really don't have too much of a problem as far as uh industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here	sv	sd
and that is the effects of acid rain com coming basically from coal plants in ohio and illinois and indiana	sd	sv
actually down here we don't have a big problem with uh with air pollution	sv	sd
mainly because we don't have anybody to th to either side of us	sd	sv
oh yes	ny	b
and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants uh or alkaline liking plants are not lasting anymore because the soil levels the is changing as this acid rain continues to fall	sv	sd
uh you know governor mario going after you know governors of ohio and il and indiana to fix what's going on down there	sv	sd

uh	%	b
uh	%	b
	x	b
and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist	sd	sv
in that he's a very considerate person	sd	sv
but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and and in the home	sv	sd
but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote	^q	sd
	x	b
well	%	h
um	%	b
i guess ha	aa	%
	x	%
